<p class="text">
    Due to changes made to Mixcloud's website, it is no longer possible to integrate tracklists directly on the Mixcloud webpage.
    <br />
    Now, you can access and interact with tracklists through the extension's browser popup, rather than directly on the
    Mixcloud site.
    <br />
    Simply click the extension icon to view the tracklist. You can still conveniently play tracks
    directly from this popup.
    <br />
    Tracklist displayed is the one from your first mixcloud open tab (if you have multiple tabs open). Tracklists from multiple tabs will be handled in a future update.
    Enjoy an uninterrupted Mixcloud experience with our updated functionality!
