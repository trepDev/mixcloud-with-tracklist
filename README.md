## Limitations:
### General Limitations
- Tracklists and timestamps are available only when the mix uploader has provided them.
- The displayed tracklist is from your first open Mixcloud tab (if you have multiple tabs open).
By first, I mean the one on the far left.
- Don't work on mobile website (m.mixcloud.com). Mixcloud has limited its functionality, encouraging users to migrate to the mobile app.
Therefore, mobile website version is not scheduled for implementation.
### Track Playing Limitations
- Playing Track in media player works only for tracks with timestamp available.

## Privacy Policy
No personal info is used/collected.

## Scheduled updates for the future 
- Manage tracklist from multi-tab
